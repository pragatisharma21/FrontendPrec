            <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
            <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with properties, 
                composition and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that
                 explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
            <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
            <p>the <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. 
                Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. 
                Each element are classified into groups and periods based on their properties</p>
                <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
                <p>chemical reaction are represented using <i>chemical equations</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
                <p>2H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr;2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
                <p>this equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas<dfn>(H<sub>2</sub>)</dfn> and 
                    oxygen gas( <dfn>O<sub>2</sub></dfn>)to form water <dfn>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</dfn></p>
                    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
                    <p><m>stoichiometery</m> is the calculation of reactants and product in Chemical reactions. It involves
                         balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
                    </p>
                    <p><subscripts>subscripts</subscripts>indicates the number of atmos of each elementin a molecule, while
                         <superscripts>superscript</superscripts>represent charges or the number of atomsin an ion</p>
                         <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                         <p>chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. 
                            From the composition of the air we breate to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences
                        every aspect of our lives. </p>
